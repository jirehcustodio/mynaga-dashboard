## **Important Notes:**

### ‚úÖ This Method:
- Your sheet is **NOT publicly searchable** on Google
- Only people with the exact URL can access it
- Perfect for internal/private data that doesn't need high security
- Takes 2 minutes to set up

### ‚ùå Don't Use Regular Sheet URL:
- ‚ùå NOT THIS: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_ID/edit`
- ‚úÖ USE THIS: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/YOUR_ID/pub?output=csv`

### üîí Need Higher Security?
If your data is highly sensitive and you don't want ANY publish link:
- See `GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE.md` for Service Account method
- Requires Google Cloud setup (10 minutes one-time)
- Sheet stays 100% private with no publish link

## **Expected Column Names:**

Your Google Sheet should have columns like:

| Column Name | Also Accepts | Required? |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Control No. | Control No, ID, Case ID | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Category | Type, Issue Type | No |
| Sender's Location | Location, Address | No |
| Barangay | Brgy | No |
| Description | Details | No |
| Date Created | Date, Created At | No |
| Reported by | Reporter, Name | No |
| Contact Number | Contact, Phone | No |
| Link to Report | Link, URL | No |
| MyNaga App Status | App Status | No |
| Status | Case Status | No |

**Note:** The system is flexible - it will match similar column names automatically.

## **Troubleshooting:**

### Error: "Connection failed" or "500 error"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you published as **CSV** (not Web page)
2. Use the published CSV URL, not the regular sheet URL
3. Make sure your sheet has data with at least "Control No." column

### Error: "Access denied"
**Solution:**
- The publish link might not be active yet
- Try Step 2 again and make sure you clicked "Publish"
- Wait 1 minute and try again

### Data not syncing correctly
**Solution:**
1. Check your column names match the expected names above
2. Make sure "Control No." column exists and has unique values
3. Look at the sync results for specific error messages
